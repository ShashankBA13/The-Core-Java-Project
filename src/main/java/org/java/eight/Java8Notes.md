# List of features introduced in Java 8

---

1. **Lambda Expressions** - Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions, allowing functional programming style in Java.
2. **Default methods** - Default methods allow interfaces to have concrete method implementations, enabling backward compatibility
                 for existing interfaces when new methods are added.
3. **Stream API** - The Stream API provides a declarative approach to process collections of data in a functional programming style.
4. **Functional Interfaces** - Functional interfaces are interfaces that have a single abstract method, making them suitable for use with lambda expressions.
5. **Method Reference** - Method reference's provide a shorthand syntax for referring to methods or constructors using lambda-like notation.
6. **Optional Class** - The Optional class is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value, helping to avoid NullPointerExceptions.
7. **Date Time API** - Replaces the legacy Date and Calendar classes with a new Date and Time API.
